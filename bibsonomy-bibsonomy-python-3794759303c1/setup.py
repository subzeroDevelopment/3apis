BibSonomy REST client
---------------------

This library provides a Python abstraction to BibSonomy's REST
library. In particular, it can
- retrieve posts for users and/or tags
- download documents (incl. preview images) for publication posts
- retrieve information about users

Its functionality can and will be extended to other queries currently
supported by the REST API
(cf. https://bitbucket.org/bibsonomy/bibsonomy/wiki/documentation/api/REST%20API).
